Al-Ameen Digital: Data Privacy and Customer Consent Policy
Policy Owner: Head of Technology Last Revised: 2025-09-01
1. Scope and Definitions
This policy applies to all Personal Identifiable Information (PII) collected from customers residing in the State of Qatar.
2. Data Collection and Usage
We collect PII necessary for credit scoring, identity verification (KYC), and service provision. PII collected includes full name, national ID number, and contact details.
2.1 Customer Consent
We obtain explicit consent for two key purposes: a) To process PII for the core P2P lending service. b) To share anonymized transaction data with our external analytics partner, 'DataMetrics Ltd.', to refine our credit risk model. This sharing requires a separate check-box consent during onboarding.
3. Data Storage and Disposal
3.1 Location: All customer data is currently processed and stored within our secure cloud environment, hosted across the AWS regions in Ireland and Singapore. This provides excellent geographic redundancy. 3.2 Access: Access to raw PII is restricted via multi-factor authentication and only granted to the Head of Technology and two designated Data Analysts. 3.3 Retention: Data is retained for 7 years after the termination of the customer relationship.
4. Third-Party Data Sharing
We share data only with service providers strictly necessary for our operation, such as the KYC provider 'ID-Verify Pro' and the payment processor 'SwiftPay Global'. Customers are notified of these third parties in our service agreement.
